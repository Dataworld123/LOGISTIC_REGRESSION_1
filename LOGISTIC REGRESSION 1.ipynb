    "Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm, meaning it is originally designed for problems with two classes (e.g., binary outcomes like yes/no). However, there are techniques to extend logistic regression for multiclass classification problems, where there are more than two classes. Two common approaches for achieving multiclass classification using logistic regression are the \"One-vs-Rest\" (OvR) or \"One-vs-All\" and the \"Multinomial\" (Softmax) methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-vs-Rest (OvR) or One-vs-All:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OvR approach, a separate binary logistic regression model is trained for each class, treating it as the positive class while combining the rest of the classes into a single negative class.\n",
    "For example, if there are three classes (A, B, C), three logistic regression models are trained:\n",
    "Model 1: Class A vs. Not Class A (B or C)\n",
    "Model 2: Class B vs. Not Class B (A or C)\n",
    "Model 3: Class C vs. Not Class C (A or B)\n",
    "During prediction, each model provides a probability for the instance belonging to its assigned class, and the class with the highest probability is predicted.\n",
    "Multinomial (Softmax):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial approach directly extends logistic regression to handle multiple classes without creating binary models. It involves modifying the logistic regression's output layer to use the Softmax activation function, which normalizes the raw model outputs into a probability distribution over all classes.\n",

    "During training, the model's parameters (weights) are learned to maximize the likelihood of the observed class labels.\n",
    "The choice between OvR and Multinomial depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, the number of classes, and the computational efficiency. OvR is often used when dealing with a large number of classes or when logistic regression models are computationally expensive. On the other hand, Multinomial logistic regression provides a more direct and computationally efficient solution for multiclass problems when resources allow.\n",
